# DAMVi_App
Biomechanics is the application of math and physics to understand biological motion. Experiments involve diverse equipment to measure motion, acceleration, force, oxygen consumption and others. It is a field with scientists from diverse backgrounds such as sciences, engineering, healthcare or education. It is important for them to produce new and meaningful insights, to reproduce prior works and build an understanding of their own. Learning to use research equipment and analyze their data can be an arduous and time consuming task for new students. Teaching their use can be time consuming for faculty and staff. The Biomechanics Analysis and Reporting Application (BAR App) is a package that aims to facilitate these efforts by offering a dynamic framework to extract data, perform data processing and analysis, produce figures, and format the results for additional statistical analysis. The package allows new users to develop their own code within a framework that promotes their own learning but handles more nuanced, but time-consuming aspects of data processing. Furthermore, it allows experienced users to better reuse code for repeated and complex analysis methods, which new users can also run while developing their own understanding of the methods.

# Statement of need


BAR App is a MATLAB package intended for use in the field of biomechanics. MATLAB is commonly used in this field but code is often specific to individual groups or experiments with little cross-compatibility. These scientists may be students with little programming experience, experienced research staff or faculty. The package provides a high-level user interface with a dynamic environment. This allows users across groups to develop their code and make use of other contributions. It interfaces well with existing packages like the NONANLibrary and can make use of others like the MOVAN-Library with modifications. Biomechanics research makes use of varied equipment, raw data formats and analysis methods. As an open-source contribution, the BAR App provides a structured framework for this research to consolidate efforts and increase reproducibility in data analysis.

This package was designed within a biomechanics laboratory with a focus on reusing existing code and providing a tool for medical and physical therapy graduate students, and undergraduate students, to use on their own. Within its framework, complex analysis code could be developed for a particular project and reused for another. The high-level interface allows students with little programming experience to use the same code, promoting independence from research staff in their work. In these ways it would increase the productivity of a lab and the quality of their contributions.
