function dataout = load_AllFiles_AllFiles(file)
% [dataout] = load__AllFiles(file)
% inputs  - file, this input is not used.
% outputs - dataout, this output is not used
% Remarks
% - This function is a placeholder so all files can be moved and copied within the DAMVi App. These files will have varied formats and would not be 
%   loaded into DAMVi. Only the file names are used.
% Future Work
% - Possibly these files could be read directly into MATLAB.
