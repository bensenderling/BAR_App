function dataout = load_agd_Actigraph(file)
% [dataout] = load_agd_Actigraph(file)
% inputs  - file, this input is not used.
% outputs - dataout, this output is not used
% Remarks
% - This function is a placeholder so agd files can be moved and copied
%   within the BAR App. These files are binary and currently there is not a
%   way to load them directly into MATLAB.
% Future Work
% - Possibly these files could be read directly into MATLAB.
